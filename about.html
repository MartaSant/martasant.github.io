      <p style="font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.6;">
        Food Facts is a quiet corner of the internet dedicated to how everyday foods are produced,
        processed, labelled and sometimes overproduced. It looks at food not only as something on your
        plate, but as the result of long chains of decisions: from fields and factories to logistics,
        marketing, regulation and waste.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.6;">
        The goal is simple: to help you understand the story behind what you buy, cook and eat, so you
        can make more informed choices that respect your health, your budget and the people and
        resources involved in food production.

      <h2 style="font-size:1.15rem; margin-bottom:0.5rem;">2. Who is behind Food Facts?</h2>
      <p style="font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.6;">
        Food Facts is created and written by <strong>Marta Rossi</strong>, an Italian food scientist
        specialising in food production processes, food waste and sustainable supply chains.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.6;">
        Marta holds a <strong>Laurea Magistrale in Food Science and Technology (LM-70)</strong> from the
        <strong>University of Bologna</strong>, one of Europe’s leading institutions in agricultural and
        food sciences. During her studies she focused on food processing technologies, quality control,
        EU food law and the environmental impact of the agri-food sector.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.6;">
        Along the way, she worked on projects related to life-cycle assessment of food products, food
        loss along the supply chain and optimisation of processing steps to reduce waste, collaborating
        with local food companies and research groups on sustainable innovation in the Italian
        agri-food system.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.6;">
        On Food Facts, Marta’s aim is to translate scientific literature, EU regulations and production
        data into accessible, evidence-based articles that connect directly to your supermarket basket
        and kitchen.

    <section class="contact-box" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      <h2 style="font-size:1.15rem; margin-bottom:0.5rem;">3. How articles are written</h2>
      <p style="font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.6;">
        Food systems are complex, and it’s easy to get lost between marketing claims, strong opinions
        and scary headlines. To keep a steady line, articles on Food Facts follow a simple
        methodology:
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-left:1.2rem; font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.6;">
        <li><strong>Start from real products and processes</strong> &mdash; posts often begin with a very
          concrete question: how is this specific food made, what does this label mean, what happens when
          there is a surplus of a certain product?</li>
        <li><strong>Look at multiple sources</strong> &mdash; scientific papers, EU regulations, technical
          documents, industry reports, and qualitative sources (such as interviews and field experience)
          are considered together.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid “good vs bad” shortcuts</strong> &mdash; instead of treating “industrial” and
          “homemade” as automatic opposites, the focus is on conditions, trade-offs and practical
          context.</li>
        <li><strong>Translate without oversimplifying</strong> &mdash; whenever technical terms are used,
          they are explained in plain language, but nuances are kept instead of forcing everything into
          black-and-white answers.</li>
        <li><strong>Connect back to daily life</strong> &mdash; theory is linked to what you actually see
          in shops: labels, price differences, promotions, formats and waste at home.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.15rem; margin-bottom:0.5rem;">4. What Food Facts is (and isn’t)</h2>
      <p style="font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.6;">
        To keep expectations clear:
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-left:1.2rem; font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.6;">
        <li><strong>Food Facts is</strong> a place for:
          <ul style="margin-top:0.25rem; margin-left:1.1rem;">
            <li>explaining how foods are produced and processed;</li>
            <li>reading labels with more context and less anxiety;</li>
            <li>understanding how overproduction and waste happen along the chain;</li>
            <li>receiving realistic, non-judgmental suggestions for everyday decisions.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="margin-top:0.5rem;"><strong>Food Facts is not</strong>:
          <ul style="margin-top:0.25rem; margin-left:1.1rem;">
            <li>a personalised nutrition service or medical consultation;</li>
            <li>a space for strict rules, guilt-based advice or “perfect diets”;</li>
            <li>a place where companies pay to have their products promoted.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p style="font-size:0.9rem; line-height:1.6; color:var(--color-muted); margin-top:0.5rem;">
        Articles are for information and reflection, not for diagnosing, treating or replacing advice
        from your own healthcare professionals.

    <section class="contact-box" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      <h2 style="font-size:1.15rem; margin-bottom:0.5rem;">5. How to use this blog</h2>
      <p style="font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.6;">
        You don’t need to read Food Facts as if it were a textbook. Think of it more like a curious
        friend who loves both food and data and shares what she finds out, calmly and with references.
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-left:1.2rem; font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.6; margin-top:0.5rem;">
        <li>Browse the <a href="blog.html">Articles</a> page by topic or using the search and category
          filters.</li>
        <li>Use posts as a starting point for your own questions about labels, processing and waste.</li>
        <li>Take only what feels useful and realistic for your situation; leave the rest.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.6; margin-top:0.5rem;">
        Small, informed shifts over time are more powerful than sudden, rigid overhauls.
