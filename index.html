                <h3>About Marta</h3>
                <p>
                  Marta Rossi is an Italian food scientist specializing in food production processes,
                  food waste, and sustainable supply chains. She holds a Laurea Magistrale in Food
                  Science and Technology (LM-70) from the University of Bologna, one of Europe’s
                  leading institutions in agricultural and food sciences, where her studies focused
                  on food processing technologies, quality control, EU food law, and environmental
                  impacts of the agri-food sector.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During her academic path, Marta worked on projects related to life-cycle assessment
                  of food products, food loss along the supply chain, and optimization of processing
                  steps to reduce waste, collaborating with local food companies and research groups
                  on sustainable innovation in the Italian agri-food system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On Food Facts, Marta translates scientific literature, EU regulations, and
                  production data into accessible, evidence-based articles. She documents how food is
                  grown, processed, packaged and distributed – and why, in a world where roughly one
                  third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted, rethinking
                  production and overproduction is crucial for both climate and food security.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Her goal is to help readers understand the hidden side of food abundance: surplus
                  production, unsold stock, processing by-products and household waste – and to show
                  how better technology, smarter policies and informed daily choices can all
                  contribute to a more sustainable food system.

        <!-- Intro Food Facts -->
        <div class="hero-card">
          <p>Hi, I'm Marta, the curious mind behind Food Facts.</p>
          <p>
            I created this space to talk about what’s really behind what we eat:
            ingredients, nutrition, labels, and the processes that turn raw crops
            into the food on our shelves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here you’ll find simple explanations about food production, how different
            foods are made, what terms on packaging actually mean, and how to make
            more informed choices without fear or perfectionism.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re curious about how food is grown, processed, packed, and brought
            to your table, you’re in the right place.

          <p class="post-excerpt">
            Cheap food and constant promotions look like a win for our wallets, but they often hide
            overproduction, waste and pressure on farmers, workers and the environment.

            Behind every carton of milk and every jar of tomato sauce there is a long story.
