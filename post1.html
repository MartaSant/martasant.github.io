        <h2>Welcome to Food Facts</h2>
        <p>
          Have you ever stood in front of a supermarket shelf, staring at five different brands
          of the same product, and thought:
        </p>
        <p><em>“What’s actually behind all this food?”</em></p>
        <p>
          Behind every carton of milk, every packet of crackers and every jar of tomato sauce,
          there is a long, complex story: fields, factories, logistics, marketing, regulations,
          price wars, and too often… waste.
        </p>
        <p>
          Food Facts was born from a simple idea:
          if we understand how our food is produced, processed and often overproduced, we can make
          more conscious choices – for our health, for the environment, and for the people working
          along the food chain.
        </p>
        <p>
          This first post is a kind of manifesto: an introduction to who I am, what this blog is
          about, and why your food’s story really matters.
        </p>

        <h2>Who I am (and why I care about this)</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I’m Marta, and I live in Italy – a country where food is much more than fuel.
          It’s culture, identity, family traditions, and sometimes drama at the dinner table.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like many people, I grew up surrounded by strong opinions about food:
          “industrial food is bad,” “homemade is always better,” “if it’s expensive, it must be healthy,”
          and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, I realised that reality is more complex than slogans.
        </p>
        <p>
          I became increasingly curious about what happens before food reaches our plates:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What actually changes when a food is processed on an industrial scale?</li>
          <li>Are “clean labels” always better, or just better marketing?</li>
          <li>How can we talk about sustainability when tons of perfectly edible food are thrown away?</li>
          <li>Why do we often know the brand’s story, but not the product’s story?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          My background in food and nutrition gave me tools to read scientific papers, regulations and
          technical documents – but I also saw how distant that language can feel from everyday life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Food Facts is my attempt to build a bridge:
          between the complexity of food systems and the reality of your supermarket basket.
        </p>

        <h2>What Food Facts is (and what it isn’t)</h2>
        <p>
          This blog is not a recipe website, even if recipes and meal ideas may appear sometimes.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Food Facts is a space where we talk about:</strong></p>

        <h3>1. How foods are produced</h3>
        <p><em>From field to factory to shelf:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Where raw materials come from.</li>
          <li>Which processing steps they go through (pasteurisation, ultra-processing, fermentation, freezing, canning…).</li>
          <li>Why these steps exist – safety, shelf life, flavour, convenience – and what they change in the final product.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. What’s behind food labels</h3>
        <p>
          Labels are one of the few tools we have in our hands as consumers, but they’re not always easy to read.
        </p>
        <p>Here we’ll explore:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ingredients lists and what they really tell you.</li>
          <li>Nutritional tables: beyond calories and protein claims.</li>
          <li>
            Marketing messages such as “natural,” “rich in fibre,” “high protein,” “no added sugar”
            – and their limits.
          </li>
          <li>Certifications and seals (organic, origin labels, sustainability logos).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Overproduction and waste</h3>
        <p>We live in a paradox:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Supermarket shelves are full.</li>
          <li>Yet farmers may struggle to stay in business.</li>
          <li>And huge amounts of food are thrown away at every stage of the chain.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          On Food Facts, we’ll look at food overproduction as a system issue:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Why more food is produced than we can actually consume.</li>
          <li>How quality standards, promotions and logistics create waste.</li>
          <li>What all this means in terms of land use, water, emissions and labour.</li>
          <li>What can realistically be done – from policies to small daily habits.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why your food’s story matters</h2>
        <p>
          You might ask: “Do I really need to know how my yogurt is made to live my life?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course not. But knowing more about food production can change the way we see everyday choices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding the story behind your food helps you to:
        </p>
        <h3>See the bigger picture</h3>
        <p>
          A cheap product is not “just cheap”. Its price reflects decisions about ingredients, processing,
          workers, waste and risk.
        </p>

        <h3>Recognise trade-offs</h3>
        <p>
          Convenience, shelf life, taste, nutrition, cost and sustainability don’t always point in the same
          direction. There is no perfect product – but there are informed choices.
        </p>

        <h3>Avoid being guided only by marketing</h3>
        <p>
          When you understand what stands behind a phrase like “artisan style” or “natural ingredients”,
          you are less likely to buy just a story.
        </p>

        <h3>Appreciate good work</h3>
        <p>
          Many farmers, technicians, workers and companies are genuinely trying to improve things.
          Knowing the process helps us recognise and support better practices.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most importantly, when we see food as part of a system, we stop thinking only in terms of “good” vs “bad”
          and start asking more useful questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>“Under which conditions was this produced?”</li>
          <li>“What am I paying for?”</li>
          <li>“Is there a less wasteful option that still works for me?”</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What you’ll find on this blog</h2>
        <p>In the next posts, you can expect:</p>

        <h3>Deep dives into specific foods</h3>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“From wheat to breakfast cereal”,</li>
          <li>“How milk becomes UHT and yogurt”,</li>
          <li>“What happens to a tomato between the field and the can”.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Practical label guides</h3>
        <p>Short, clear posts on things like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>how to read an ingredients list,</li>
          <li>what “additives” actually do,</li>
          <li>how to interpret sugar and fat on the label.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Explainers on production processes</h3>
        <p>
          We’ll talk about pasteurisation, ultra-processing, freezing, canning, modified atmosphere and more –
          not to scare you, but to help you understand why they exist and what they change.
        </p>

        <h3>Posts on overproduction and waste</h3>
        <p>
          Who wastes what, where, and why – and what part we play at home, in the kitchen and at the supermarket.
        </p>

        <h3>Small, realistic suggestions</h3>
        <p>
          I’m not here to tell you what you “must” eat. Instead, I’ll offer information and small, concrete ideas
          so you can decide what fits your values, budget and lifestyle.
        </p>

        <h2>How I’ll write (and how you can read)</h2>
        <p>My promise to you is simple:</p>

        <h3>Clarity</h3>
        <p>
          When technical terms appear, I’ll explain them. You should not need a science degree to follow a post.
        </p>

        <h3>Honesty</h3>
        <p>
          If experts disagree on something, I’ll say so. I won’t pretend that complex issues are simple just to give
          you a neat headline.
        </p>

        <h3>Nuance</h3>
        <p>
          “Industrial = bad” and “homemade = good” are easy narratives, but they’re not always true.
          We’ll try to stay in the real world, full of grey areas.
        </p>

        <h3>Practicality</h3>
        <p>
          Whenever possible, I’ll connect theory to everyday life: what you buy, how you store food,
          how you plan meals and handle leftovers.
        </p>

        <p>
          You don’t have to read every article as if it were a lesson.
          Think of Food Facts as a curious friend who loves both food and data and shares what she discovers –
          with references, but without arrogance.
        </p>

        <h2>Your role in Food Facts</h2>
        <p>
          Food systems are huge, and I don’t pretend to cover everything or have all the answers.
        </p>
        <p>That’s where you come in.</p>
        <p>You can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Suggest products or processes you’d like to understand better.</li>
          <li>Ask questions when something isn’t clear.</li>
          <li>Share posts that you find useful.</li>
          <li>Bring your own experiences, doubts and ideas.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The more we talk about how food is really made, the harder it becomes for waste, bad practices
          or empty marketing to hide in the background.
        </p>

        <h2>Welcome on board 💬🥦</h2>
        <p>
          If you’ve arrived at the end of this post, thank you.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is only the beginning. From here, we’ll open the “black box” of food production step by step:
          product by product, process by process, fact by fact.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next article, we’ll start with something very familiar and very Italian:
          the journey of a tomato from field to can – and what that story can teach us about quality,
          price and waste.
        </p>
        <p>
          Welcome to Food Facts. Let’s follow your food’s story together, from field to fork.
