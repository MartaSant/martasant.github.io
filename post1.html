      <p class="page-subtitle">
        Cheap prices and big promotions look like a win for everyone, but behind them
        there is a system that often produces more food than we can eat – and someone
        else is paying the difference.

      <div class="post-body">
        <h2>Why “good deals” aren’t always good news</h2>
        <p>Walk into any supermarket and you’ll see them everywhere:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“Buy 2, get 1 free”</li>
          <li>“Family size – super value!”</li>
          <li>€0.39 pasta, €0.99 milk, huge packs of snacks at irresistible prices</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It looks like a celebration of abundance. Food is cheaper, more available, and
          more varied than ever before.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there’s a side of this story we don’t see on the price tag:
          <strong>overproduction</strong> – making more food than we can reasonably eat –
          and the long chain of consequences that follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this post, we’ll look behind the apparent convenience of cheap food and
          explore what it really costs in terms of waste, environment, workers, and
          consumers themselves.
        </p>

        <h2>The paradox of abundance</h2>
        <p>On the surface, cheap food feels like a win:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We can fill the trolley without emptying our wallet.</li>
          <li>Supermarkets look full, clean, safe and efficient.</li>
          <li>Promotions make us feel clever for “saving money”.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But behind that abundance, there is a paradox:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Farmers may be paid so little that their work barely covers production costs.</li>
          <li>
            Tons of food are discarded at different stages of the chain
            (field, factory, distribution, home).
          </li>
          <li>Environmental pressure increases: land use, water use, greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
          <li>Consumers get used to a distorted idea of what food “should” cost.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In other words: what looks cheap at the checkout isn’t necessarily cheap for
          the system as a whole.
        </p>

        <h2>How the system creates overproduction</h2>
        <p>
          Food overproduction doesn’t happen by accident. It is built into the way
          our food system works.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some of the mechanisms that push towards “always more”:</p>

        <h3>1. Competing on price</h3>
        <p>
          Large retailers and brands often compete primarily on price. To keep products
          cheap and shelves full, they need:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>High volumes: the more they produce and sell, the more they can dilute costs.</li>
          <li>Standardised products: fewer variations, more uniformity, easier large-scale production.</li>
          <li>Tight margins: everyone in the chain is pressured to cut costs somewhere.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This race to the bottom encourages producing more than is actually needed,
          just to maintain market share and negotiating power.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Promotions that move volume, not necessarily value</h3>
        <p>
          Promotions like “3×2”, “buy one, get one free” or “family pack” are designed to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Stimulate extra purchases (often of products we wouldn’t have bought otherwise).</li>
          <li>Empty warehouses to make space for new stock.</li>
          <li>Help brands and retailers appear “cheap” compared to competitors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On paper, this moves volume. In reality, part of that extra volume may:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Never be sold in time (and be discarded by the retailer).</li>
          <li>End up in the bin at home because we bought more than we could consume.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The system counts the product leaving the shelf as success, even if it later becomes waste.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Strict aesthetic and quality standards</h3>
        <p>
          To meet consumer expectations and branding strategies, many products must look “perfect”:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fruits and vegetables with the right size, shape and colour.</li>
          <li>Biscuits and snacks with consistent appearance.</li>
          <li>Packaged foods with very precise texture and visual standards.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Anything that doesn’t fit these criteria may be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Redirected to other uses (processing, animal feed, industry).</li>
          <li>Sold at a lower price.</li>
          <li>Or simply thrown away.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Perfection in appearance often means loss in the background.</p>

        <h3>4. Contracts and planning</h3>
        <p>
          Food production requires planning months or years in advance:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Farmers sign contracts to supply fixed quantities.</li>
          <li>Factories schedule production based on forecasts.</li>
          <li>Retailers order large volumes to secure better prices.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Forecasts, however, are never perfect. When demand is overestimated, the system has
          created more food than it can sell – and someone has to absorb that loss.
        </p>

        <h2>The hidden costs the shelf price doesn’t show</h2>
        <p>
          When we pay very little for food, it’s easy to forget that someone else may be
          paying the difference.
        </p>
        <p>Let’s look at some of these “invisible” costs.</p>

        <h3>1. Environmental cost</h3>
        <p>
          Overproduction doesn’t just mean “a few extra boxes lying around”. To produce food, we use:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Land – fields that could be used differently, or not used at all.</li>
          <li>Water – irrigation, cleaning, processing.</li>
          <li>Energy – machinery, transport, refrigeration.</li>
          <li>Inputs – fertilisers, pesticides, packaging materials.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When food ends up discarded, all those resources have been spent for nothing. The emissions,
          pollution and resource use remain, even if the product never reaches your plate.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a world where we talk more and more about climate change and sustainability, producing more
          than we need is like heating a house with the windows open.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Social cost for workers and farmers</h3>
        <p>
          Low prices and high volumes often translate into pressure on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Farmers, who may struggle to cover production costs, especially for commodities
            (wheat, milk, tomatoes, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>
            Seasonal and migrant workers, who may work under harsh conditions for very low wages.
          </li>
          <li>
            Small producers, who can’t compete with the scale and bargaining power of large companies.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Cheap food can hide situations where the real cost is borne by those at the beginning of the chain –
          the people who grow, harvest, process and pack our food.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Cost for consumers’ relationship with food</h3>
        <p>
          Overproduction and constant promotions also have subtle effects on how we relate to food:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We get used to the idea that “real price” is the discounted one, and anything else feels expensive.
          </li>
          <li>
            We lose the perception of seasonality; if strawberries are always available, their value feels lower.
          </li>
          <li>
            Food becomes more of a product and less of something connected to land, work and time.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When food is always abundant and cheap, it’s easier to waste it without thinking too much.
          Throwing away a product that cost very little feels less serious – even if the real cost was much higher.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Nutritional and quality trade-offs</h3>
        <p>
          To keep prices low while meeting expectations of taste, convenience and long shelf life, producers may:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use cheaper ingredients.</li>
          <li>Rely more on ultra-processing.</li>
          <li>Reformulate products to be hyper-palatable (high in salt, sugar, fats).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This doesn’t mean all cheap food is automatically “bad” and all expensive food is “good”.
          Reality is more nuanced.
        </p>
        <p>
          But overproduction in a low-price system tends to favour products that are cheap to produce
          and easy to sell in large quantities, not necessarily those that are best for long-term health.
        </p>

        <h2>It’s not just about “individual responsibility”</h2>
        <p>
          At this point, it might be tempting to say:
        </p>
        <p><em>“Ok, so I just have to stop wasting food and stop buying promotions.”</em></p>
        <p>
          Individual actions matter, but it’s important to be clear:
          <strong>overproduction is a structural problem</strong>, not just a matter of personal guilt.
        </p>
        <p>
          You didn’t design pricing policies.<br />
          You didn’t decide supermarket standards or marketing strategies.<br />
          You didn’t create the rules of international trade.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blaming individual consumers alone is like blaming passengers for the route chosen by the bus driver.
        </p>
        <p>
          What we can do, however, is understand the system better and gradually adjust our choices –
          while also supporting broader changes.
        </p>

        <h2>What can be done? System and everyday actions</h2>
        <p>
          Solving overproduction and its hidden costs requires action on many levels.
          Here are some directions – not as magic solutions, but as possible steps.
        </p>

        <h3>On a systemic level (policies, companies, institutions)</h3>
        <p><strong>Support for fair prices</strong><br />
          Mechanisms that allow farmers to cover production costs and invest in better practices –
          without forcing them into a constant volume race.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Incentives to reduce waste along the chain</strong><br />
          Better planning, redistribution of surplus, and transparency about where and how much waste happens.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Rethinking promotions</strong><br />
          Moving from volume-based promotions (buy more!) to value-based approaches
          (better quality, fairer origin, less waste).
        </p>
        <p><strong>Clearer information</strong><br />
          Labels and communication that don’t just sell a story, but explain more honestly what we are paying for.
        </p>
        <p>
          As individual consumers we don’t control these levers directly, but we can support companies and
          initiatives that move in this direction and bring these topics into public conversation.
        </p>

        <h3>In everyday life (our sphere of influence)</h3>
        <p>
          We don’t have to change everything overnight. But we can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Buy with more intention</strong> – Ask: “Will I really eat this before it expires?”
            before falling for “extra-large” packs just because they are cheap.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Plan a little</strong> – Even a simple shopping list can reduce impulse buying
            driven by promotions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Normalise “less perfect” food</strong> – Choose “imperfect” fruit and vegetables
            when possible – they taste the same and help reduce waste.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Value what we already have at home</strong> – Cook with what’s in the cupboard
            and fridge before buying more. Leftover-based meals are a quiet way to resist overproduction.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Support better practices when we can</strong> – Sometimes it means choosing a product
            that costs slightly more but comes from a more transparent or fair chain.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These are not heroic actions. They are small shifts in perspective that, repeated over time and
          across many people, send a signal to the market.
        </p>

        <h2>Cheap for whom?</h2>
        <p>
          The next time you see a shockingly low price or an aggressive promotion, you don’t need to feel guilty
          for being tempted. It’s normal – the system is designed to work that way.
        </p>
        <p>
          But you can pause for a second and ask:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>“Cheap for whom?”</li>
          <li>“Who is paying the difference?”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Sometimes the answer is:
          the environment, workers, farmers, or even ourselves in the form of waste and poorer food relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          This post isn’t about telling you what to buy.
          It’s about pulling back the curtain on a mechanism that often stays invisible behind the price tag.
        </p>

        <h2>What’s next on Food Facts</h2>
        <p>
          In upcoming posts, we’ll dive into concrete examples of overproduction:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What happens when there is a tomato surplus?</li>
          <li>How do dairy surpluses affect the types of products we see on shelves?</li>
          <li>How do promotions and big formats influence waste at home?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Piece by piece, we’ll map how our food system turns “more and cheaper” into a rule – and what
          paths we have, even small ones, to imagine something different.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, you can keep this simple idea with you:
        </p>
        <p><strong>
          If a food is extremely cheap, someone – or something – else is probably paying part of the bill.
        </strong></p>
        <p>
          And asking who is the first step toward changing the story.
